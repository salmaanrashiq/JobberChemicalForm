## Inspiration

In jobber's reviews online there are multiple calls for an option to manage the chemicals they use at every job

 ```
 For a pest control company, they need to improve the chemicals management.
 They have some forms, and maybe there are not exactly what you are looking for and,
 for the moment you cannot customize them.

 ```

 ```
 We are a Pest Control Company and the software has a lack of some important things
 that a company like this needs, specially the reports. They have forms to manage and
 fill chemicals but unfortunately they are not quite useful.

 - Angela from Pest Control Service 01/2018

## Additions

- Implement custom form templates that are user friendly to manipulate
- Allow users to generate any use-disclosure forms that are necessary for the controlled chemicals they're using.
- Add a backend that stores the form templates and form data
